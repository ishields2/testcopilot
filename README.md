### üßÆ How TestCopilot Scores Files

TestCopilot gives each test file a score out of 100 based on two things:

1. ‚úÖ **How many tests pass**
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **How serious the problems are in the ones that fail**

We split the score like this:

- **70%** of the score is based on the pass rate  
  ‚Üí The more tests that pass, the higher the base score  
- **30%** is based on the severity of issues in failing tests  
  ‚Üí We deduct points for each SEVERE, MEDIUM, or LOW issue

---

### üî¢ Example

A file has 10 tests and 1 of them fails with a **MEDIUM** warning:

- ‚úÖ 9/10 tests passed ‚Üí 90% pass rate ‚Üí earns **63 points** (70 √ó 0.9)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 medium issue ‚Üí subtract **3 points** from quality score (starts at 30)

**Final score = 63 + 27 = 90**

---

### üö® Severity Deductions

If a test has an issue, we deduct from the 30% "quality" portion of the score:

- **SEVERE** ‚Üí -6 points
- **MEDIUM** ‚Üí -3 points
- **LOW** ‚Üí -1.5 points

---

### ‚úÖ Why This Makes Sense

- Rewards files where most tests pass
- Penalises files with more or worse issues
- Avoids giving small files inflated scores from just a single pass
# TestCopilot

TestCopilot is a tool for analyzing Cypress test files to flag poor patterns (like `cy.wait()`, deep `.then()` nesting, brittle selectors, and missing assertions) and provide a plain-English summary.

---

## Project Structure

- `/testcopilot-cli`: CLI tool for scanning test files.
- `/testcopilot-ui`: Web interface (Next.js app) for drag-and-drop test analysis and project-wide summaries.

---

## Usage (Always Run From Root)

### ‚úÖ Production-like usage (globally installed)

```powershell
tcp scan .\path	to\your	tests
```

This will:
- Run the CLI tool from anywhere in your system (once globally linked)
- Analyze all `.js` and `.ts` Cypress test files in the given path

To generate a config file interactively:

```powershell
tcp init
```

---

### üõ† Dev usage (without building or linking) (Always Run From Root)

```powershell
npx ts-node testcopilot-cli/src/index.ts scan ./test-files
```

This runs the CLI in dev mode directly via `ts-node`.

Use this during active development to avoid having to recompile and link every time.

---

## CLI Build & Setup (from `/testcopilot-cli`)

1. Compile the CLI TypeScript:
```powershell
npm run build
```

2. Link the CLI globally (to use the `tcp` command anywhere):
```powershell
npm link
```

---

## UI Dev Server (from root)

To run the drag-and-drop UI locally:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## Notes

- Changes to CLI code require re-running `npm run build` from `/testcopilot-cli`
- Changes to UI auto-reload with `npm run dev` from root
- `testcopilot.config.json` should live in the root (or be passed via `--config`)
